Okay, here is a README.md file suitable for your GitHub repository, incorporating the requested information and suggestions for professionalism.

# pyxkeyboard v1.01

A simple, customizable on-screen virtual keyboard for Linux systems (primarily X11/Xorg), featuring layout switching, key simulation via XTEST, and optional auto-show functionality using AT-SPI.

*(Suggestion: Replace placeholder.png with an actual screenshot of the keyboard)*

## Key Features

*   **On-Screen Typing:** Click keys to simulate input into other applications (using XTEST).
*   **System Layout Switching:** Easily switch between configured system keyboard layouts (e.g., English, Arabic) using the `Lang` button or the system tray menu (requires `setxkbmap`).
*   **Visual Layout Display:** Keyboard display automatically reflects the currently active system layout.
*   **Modifier Keys:** Functional `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, and `Caps Lock` keys. Modifiers like Shift, Ctrl, Alt auto-release after the next non-modifier key press.
*   **Right-Click Shift:** Right-click character keys to simulate `Shift + Key`.
*   **Customization:**
    *   Adjust font family and size.
    *   Change button text color.
    *   Set window background opacity.
    *   Choose button style (Default, Flat, Gradient).
*   **System Tray Integration:** Minimize to tray, select layout, show keyboard, and quit from the tray menu.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Remember window position and size.
    *   Optional middle-click on background to hide to tray.
    *   Toggle auto-show feature.
*   **Auto-Show (Optional):** Automatically display the keyboard when focus enters an editable text field (requires AT-SPI).
*   **Movable:** Drag the window background to reposition.
*   **Always on Top:** Stays visible above other windows.

## System Requirements

*   **Operating System:** **Linux** (Designed and tested primarily on **X11/Xorg** sessions).
    *   *Note:* Key simulation (XTEST), system layout switching (`setxkbmap`), and focus monitoring (AT-SPI) may have limited or no functionality on Wayland sessions depending on the compositor and configuration.
*   **Python:** Python 3.x

## Installation & Dependencies

Follow these steps to get `pyxkeyboard` running:

**1. Dependencies:**

You need Python 3 and several libraries. Installation commands are shown for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems. Use your distribution's package manager for equivalents.

*   **Core GUI (PyQt6):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install PyQt6
    # or potentially: sudo apt install python3-pyqt6
    ```
*   **Key Simulation (XTEST):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install python-xlib
    # or potentially: sudo apt install python3-xlib
    ```
*   **System Layout Switching (`setxkbmap` command):**
    This command is usually pre-installed with Xorg. If missing:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install x11-xkb-utils
    ```
*   **Auto-Show Feature (AT-SPI):** (Optional, only needed for auto-show)
    ```bash
    # Install Python GI bindings and AT-SPI introspection data
    sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-atspi-2.0

    # IMPORTANT: Ensure Accessibility Services (AT-SPI) are enabled!
    # Check your Desktop Environment's settings (Accessibility/Universal Access).
    # You might need to log out and back in after enabling it.
    # You can often check if it's running via: ps aux | grep -i at-spi
    ```

**2. Get the Code:**

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyxkeyboard.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd pyxkeyboard


Or download the source code ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

3. Run the Application:

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

python3 main.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Usage

Typing: Click the keys on the virtual keyboard. The input should appear in the currently focused application window (if XTEST is working).

Modifiers: Click Shift, L Ctrl, or L Alt once to activate for the next key press. They will highlight and then deactivate automatically. Click Caps Lock to toggle it. Right-click a character key for a shifted version.

Switch Layout: Click the Lang button (shows EN or AR) or use the "Select Layout" option in the system tray menu.

Settings: Click the Set button to open the Settings window. Here you can configure appearance, behavior, and view help guides.

Move: Click and drag the keyboard's background area (not the buttons).

Minimize/Hide: Click the window's close button (X) or middle-click the background (if enabled in settings) to hide to the system tray.

Show: Left-click the tray icon or right-click and select "Show Keyboard".

Quit: Right-click the tray icon and select "Quit".

For detailed instructions, please see the user guides included:

user_guide.html (English)

user_guide_ar.html (Arabic)
(These can also be accessed from the "Help" and "Arabic Help" tabs in the Settings window)

Configuration

Settings are stored automatically in ~/.xkyboard/settings.json. You can configure most options through the Set button interface:

Remember Geometry

Middle-click Hide

Auto-show on Edit Focus

Font Family & Size

Text Color

Background Opacity

Button Style

Troubleshooting

Please refer to the "Troubleshooting Notes" section in the user guides (user_guide.html or user_guide_ar.html) for common issues and solutions, especially regarding:

Typing not working (XTEST issues, Wayland)

Language switching failures (setxkbmap issues)

Auto-show problems (AT-SPI setup)

Missing tray icon

Suggestions for Professionalism

To make the project appear more professional on GitHub:

Add a Real Screenshot: Replace placeholder.png at the top with an actual, clear screenshot of the keyboard in action. A GIF showing features like layout switching or modifier highlighting would be even better.

Add Badges: Include badges at the top (e.g., from shields.io) for:

License (GPLv3)

Python Version Support (e.g., 3.8+)

Build Status (if you set up CI/CD later)

Include LICENSE File: Add a file named LICENSE to the repository containing the full text of the GPLv3 license.

Requirements File: Create a requirements.txt file listing the Python pip dependencies:

PyQt6
python-xlib
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Users can then potentially install these using pip install -r requirements.txt. Note that system dependencies (setxkbmap, python3-gi, at-spi) still need manual installation via the system package manager. Clarify this distinction.

Code Documentation: Add more docstrings to functions and classes in the Python code to explain what they do, their parameters, and what they return.

Consider Packaging: For easier distribution later, explore packaging methods like creating a .deb package, a Flatpak, or a Snap.

Contribution Guidelines: If you plan to accept contributions, add a CONTRIBUTING.md file outlining how others can help.

**To Use This:**

1.  Save the content above as a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your `pyxkeyboard` project.
2.  **Crucially, replace `placeholder.png`** in the README with an actual path to a screenshot file you add to the repository (e.g., `images/screenshot.png`). You might need to create an `images` folder.
3.  Replace `https://github.com/your-username/pyxkeyboard.git` with the correct URL after you create the repository on GitHub.
4.  Consider adding a `LICENSE` file with the GPLv3 text.
5.  Push the `README.md` file (and the screenshot and `LICENSE` file) to your GitHub repository.
