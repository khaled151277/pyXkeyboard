**To Use This:**

1.  Save the content above as a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your `pyxkeyboard` project.
2.  **Crucially, replace `placeholder.png`** in the README with an actual path to a screenshot file you add to the repository (e.g., `images/screenshot.png`). You might need to create an `images` folder.
3.  Replace `https://github.com/your-username/pyxkeyboard.git` with the correct URL after you create the repository on GitHub.
4.  Consider adding a `LICENSE` file with the GPLv3 text.
5.  Push the `README.md` file (and the screenshot and `LICENSE` file) to your GitHub repository.
